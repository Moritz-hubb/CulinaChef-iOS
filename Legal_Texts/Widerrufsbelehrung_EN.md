# Right of Withdrawal

## Right of Withdrawal

You have the right to withdraw from this contract within fourteen days without giving any reason.

The withdrawal period will expire after fourteen days from the day of the conclusion of the contract.

To exercise the right of withdrawal, you must inform us

**CulinaAI**  
**Moritz Serrin**  
**Sonnenblumenweg 8**  
**21244 Buchholz**  
**Germany**  
**E-mail: kontakt@culinaai.com**

of your decision to withdraw from this contract by an unequivocal statement (e.g., a letter sent by post, fax, or e-mail). You may use the attached model withdrawal form, but it is not obligatory.

To meet the withdrawal deadline, it is sufficient for you to send your communication concerning your exercise of the right of withdrawal before the withdrawal period has expired.

## Effects of Withdrawal

If you withdraw from this contract, we shall reimburse to you all payments received from you, including the costs of delivery (with the exception of the supplementary costs resulting from your choice of a type of delivery other than the least expensive type of standard delivery offered by us), without undue delay and in any event not later than fourteen days from the day on which we are informed about your decision to withdraw from this contract. We will carry out such reimbursement using the same means of payment as you used for the initial transaction, unless you have expressly agreed otherwise; in any event, you will not incur any fees as a result of such reimbursement.

**IMPORTANT NOTICE:** If you have expressly requested that we begin the performance of services during the withdrawal period, you shall pay us an amount which is in proportion to what has been performed until you have communicated to us your withdrawal from this contract, in comparison with the full coverage of the contract.

For digital content not supplied on a tangible medium, you will lose your right of withdrawal if we have begun with the performance of the contract after you have explicitly consented to us beginning with the performance of the contract before the withdrawal period has expired and you have acknowledged that you will lose your right of withdrawal once the contract has been fully performed.
