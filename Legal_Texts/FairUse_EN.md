# Fair Use Policy

**Usage Limits and Abuse Protection**

**Effective Date:** November 11, 2025  
**Version:** 1.0

---

## 1. Purpose of This Policy

This Fair Use Policy defines reasonable usage limits for AI-powered features within the CulinaAI app.

While the **Unlimited subscription** provides unrestricted access in principle, technical limits are applied to prevent misuse and to ensure stable availability for all users.

---

## 2. Scope of Application

This policy applies to the following AI-powered features:

- AI-based recipe generation
- AI chat (Culina Assistant)
- AI recipe analysis and customization
- Automatic nutritional calculations

---

## 3. Usage Limits

To protect system stability and fairness, the following technical limits apply:

### Daily Limit:

**100 requests per day** (00:00–23:59 UTC)  
→ Maximum number of AI interactions per day

### Monthly Limit:

**1,000 requests per calendar month**  
→ Maximum number of AI interactions per month

**Note:** Limits apply per user account. Reset occurs automatically on a daily and monthly basis.

---

## 4. What Counts as a Request?

### Counts as a request:

- Each AI recipe generation
- Each chat message sent to Culina Assistant
- Each recipe adjustment or analysis

### Does not count as a request:

- Manual recipe creation
- Saving and managing recipes
- Using the community recipe library
- Shopping list or meal planning functions

---

## 5. Typical Usage

The defined limits are generous and cover typical usage patterns.

### Example – Average User Activity:

- **3–5 recipe generations per day** → approx. 15–25 requests/day
- **10–15 chat messages** → approx. 10–15 requests/day

**→ Total: ~20–40 requests/day**

### Result:

Most users stay well below 50 requests per day and 500 per month.

---

## 6. What Happens If a Limit Is Reached?

If a user reaches a limit:

- AI features will be **temporarily disabled**.
- A **notification** will appear in the app.
- All non-AI functions remain **fully accessible**.
- Once the daily or monthly reset occurs, full AI functionality is **automatically restored**.

**Important:**  
Your subscription remains active, and all non-AI features continue to be available without restriction.

---

## 7. Abuse Protection

These limits protect against:

- Automated requests (bots)
- Misuse for commercial or external purposes
- Overloading of AI infrastructure
- Unfair resource consumption

**Legal Notice:**  
In cases of repeated abuse or attempts to bypass these limits, the provider reserves the right to suspend or restrict the account (in accordance with §8 of the Terms of Service).

---

## 8. Technical Implementation

- **Counting method:** Server-side via API gateway
- **Daily reset:** Automatically at 00:00 UTC
- **Monthly reset:** Automatically on the 1st of each month
- **Transparency:** Current usage statistics are visible in the app settings

---

## 9. Adjustment of Limits

The provider reserves the right to adjust usage limits:

- In case of significant changes to AI infrastructure costs
- Due to technical developments
- To improve user experience

**Notice:**  
Users will be informed of substantial changes at least **30 days in advance**.
