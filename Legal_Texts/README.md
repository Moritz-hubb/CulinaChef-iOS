## Translation Instructions

1. Translate each file to English
2. Save translated versions as `*_EN.md`
3. Keep the same structure and formatting
4. Maintain all **bold**, *italic*, and `code` formatting
5. Keep section numbers and hierarchy
6. Let me know when translations are ready for integration

## Format

- All files are in Markdown format
- Section headers use ## for main sections
- Paragraphs are numbered with **(1)**, **(2)**, etc.
- Lists use - (dash) for bullet points
- Important notes use **Bold:** prefix

## Integration

Once translated, I will integrate the English versions into the app
so they display for all non-German language users.
